## Features

- **Zero-install**: Run directly with a single `npx` command. Finds the installation path and restarts the app for you.
- **Any language**: Language data lives entirely in JSON packs under `src/locales/`. The translation engine holds no language of its own, so adding a language means adding a file. Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Brazilian Portuguese, and Russian ship in the box.
- **Non-invasive**: Translates only the shell UI and native menus. Code editors (Monaco), terminals (xterm), and conversation areas are left alone.
- **Byte-exact restore**: Backs up the original `app.asar` on first run. `restore` puts the official archive back unchanged.
- **Offline & private**: No network requests, no telemetry, and no access to tokens, sessions, or credentials.
- **Plural and direction aware**: Counted strings select CLDR plural forms via `Intl.PluralRules`, and right-to-left languages must declare their writing direction.

## Usage

Requires Node.js (≥16).

### Quick start

```bash
# Install a language pack (Simplified Chinese is the default)
npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale zh-CN
# 繁體中文: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale zh-Hant
# 日本語: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale ja
# 한국어: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale ko
# Español: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale es
# Deutsch: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale de
# Français: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale fr
# Português do Brasil: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale pt-BR
# Русский: npx antigravity-i18n apply --locale ru

# Restore the official build
npx antigravity-i18n restore

# Check the active language and backups
npx antigravity-i18n status

# See what language packs are bundled
npx antigravity-i18n locales
```

`zh` is shorthand for `apply --locale zh-CN`, and `en` is shorthand for `restore`.

### Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wadewu-ml/antigravity-i18n.git
cd antigravity-i18n
npm install
node bin/cli.js apply --locale zh-CN
```

### Options

  locales           List the bundled language packs

Options:
  --app-dir <path>  Antigravity installation path
  --locale <code>   Language pack to install (default: zh-CN)
  --no-restart      Do not restart the app after patching
  --no-kill         Require the app to be stopped; never terminate it

## Notes

1. **Save your work**: The tool waits up to 20 seconds for the app to exit cleanly. Save unfinished work before running.
2. **Official updates**: An Antigravity update overwrites `app.asar`. Run `apply` again afterwards.
3. **Backup files**: The first run creates `app.asar.clean-backup` under `resources`, and a later official update refreshes it from the current unpatched archive. Do not delete it by hand. Every apply/restore also leaves a timestamped `app.asar.bak-*` snapshot beside it, and these accumulate over time. `app.asar.clean-backup` alone is enough to restore, so once the current install proves itself you can delete older snapshots to free space.
4. **Switching languages**: Applying a different pack replaces the previous one directly; there is no need to `restore` in between.

## Contributing

Translations and new language packs are both welcome. The dictionary keys are the untranslated English UI strings, so the bundled pack doubles as the inventory a new language is written against:

```bash
# Print every English string a pack has to cover
node scripts/locale-report.js --keys

# Report coverage, gaps and untranslated placeholders
node scripts/locale-report.js
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the pack format, and run `npm test` before submitting a PR.
