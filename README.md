## What it does

antigravity-zh patches the renderer and native menus of the Antigravity desktop app. It keeps an untouched copy of the official `app.asar` so the `en` command can restore the official English files.

The bundled Simplified Chinese locale currently contains 609 static translations, 28 native menu labels, and 13 rules for dynamic text such as `Thought for 5s` and `3 tasks running`.

## Install and use

Requires Node.js 16 or later.

```bash
# Switch to Simplified Chinese
npx antigravity-zh zh

# Restore the official English version
npx antigravity-zh en

# Show language, installation path, and backup status
npx antigravity-zh status
```

To run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wadewu-ml/antigravity-zh.git
cd antigravity-zh
npm install
node bin/cli.js zh
```

## Important notes

**This tool modifies an installed application. Read this section before using it.**

- **Antigravity must be closed.** The tool requests a graceful shutdown and waits up to 20 seconds so the app can save its state. It force-terminates only after the timeout. Save unfinished work first, or close the app yourself and use `--no-kill`.
- **Official updates overwrite the patch.** Run `zh` again after an update. Newly added UI text may not be translated yet.
- **Keep the backup files.** The first run creates `app.asar.clean-backup` in the app's `resources` directory. It is the primary restore source. Deleting it without another pristine backup may require reinstalling Antigravity to recover the official files.
- **Modified files may affect integrity checks and official support.** If the app behaves unexpectedly, run `en` first and check whether the issue remains.
- **Only interface text is translated.** Model responses, source code, terminal output, and your own input are not rewritten.

## Security and privacy

Installing dependencies or using `npx` for the first time makes the normal npm Registry requests. After installation, the CLI runs locally and does not make its own network requests or collect telemetry.

- The injected translator traverses translatable DOM text nodes and reads a small set of accessibility attributes to find UI strings. It does not store, upload, or network-process that content, access `localStorage`, cookies, or IPC channels, or send session content, account information, or API credentials anywhere.
- Monaco, xterm, editable areas, and log areas are explicitly excluded from translation.
- The tool modifies only `app.asar` and the backup/state files it creates beside it. It does not modify the registry, install services, or create startup entries.
- External commands receive paths as argument arrays rather than shell-interpolated strings.

## Contributing

To add or correct a static translation, edit the `text` dictionary in [src/locales/zh-CN.json](./src/locales/zh-CN.json):

```json
"Original Text": "Chinese translation"
```

Run `npm test` before submitting changes. Dynamic text with runtime values needs a rule in the `patterns` array. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Additional locales can be added as `src/locales/<locale-code>.json` files without changing the JavaScript engine.
